Additional findings such as ductopenia, spill-over/piecemeal necrosis, eosinophilia, lobular inflammation,perivenular necrosis, arteritis, and inflammatory bridging,have been used in some systems for histopathological grading(see below).Treatment of acute rejection with additional immunosup-pression before a biopsy specimen is obtained may make thehistopathological diagnosis more difficult, because of subse-quent loss of the subendothelial infiltration of veins and ofeosinophils, and a relative decrease in the number of mono-nuclear inflammatory cells.
GRADING OF ACUTE LIVER ALLOGRAFT REJECTION(CRITIQUE OF CURRENTLY POPULAR SYSTEMS)
The panel reviewed each system and agreed that the con-sensus scheme should fulfill the following criteria: scientificcorrectness, clinical relevance, simplicity, and reproducibil-

Therefore, in coming to a consensus, the panel drew upon may occur at the expense of reproducibility.

Staging of Rejection. Staging of a biological phenomenon from Birmingham, in which 70% of histologically mild rejec- tion episodes received no additional immunosuppression, is performed in an attempt to codify a process that is largelyunidirectional and evolves in a predictable pattern over a without any adverse outcome.
28,29A survey of the panel mem- bers showed no clear-cut consensus on the therapeutic ap- relevant period of time. Acute liver allograft rejection is, forthe most part, widely considered to be a completely reversible proach to mild acute rejection (RAI ¡4) as defined in this report. In contrast, most centers report that patients with phenomenon. In the uncommon event of allograft failure fromacute rejection, the evolution is relatively rapid. Therefore, histopathological moderate or severe rejection (RAI ¢6) ex- perience significant elevations of liver injury tests and the acute rejection is not readily amenable to staging. Chronicrejection on the other hand, usually evolves more slowly and vast majority probably should, and usually are treated with additional immunosuppression.

At this time it is not clear whether acute and chronic rejection recommendations can be inferred from the mild acute rejec- tion grade, although some centers have exercised the option represent the ends of a spectrum of alloreactivity, or if theyare completely different biological processes.
